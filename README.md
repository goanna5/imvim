# IMVIM ðŸ”¥
*The new and improved Vimâ„¢*

Ever felt that Vim commands are too counterintuitive? Why is "j" move down and "k" move up and "l" move right?? Why can't I have a keyboard based text-editor that **makes sense??**

To fix this massive oversight we created:
- a new text-editor with *much* more intuitive commands...
- a bit of a puzzle to figure out how stuff works (cause life gets boring sometimes y'know)
- AND a level system so when it gets easy, dw, there's more!!

# The twist ðŸŽ‰
We're not telling you what any of these keybinds are ðŸ˜Š. Go figure it out - have fun!! Its intuitive, trust ðŸ¤—

# Tech stack ðŸ’ª
Python, Tkinter, thats pretty much it
